  "T20.NPCB_FoeRoleLackeyHint": "Minion. The creature was built to take on characters in large numbers. Because of this, you'll usually use minions with a CR lower than the party's level. For example, a 5th-level party might take on a bunch of CR 1 minions. Minions have higher attack and damage values, to ensure they remain a real threat to characters, even though their CR will be lower than their level, but less hitpoints, to be defeated more quickly and don't make combat excessively slow. This role is primarily occupied by humanoids and small monsters.",
