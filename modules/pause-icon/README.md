Simple module to change the image of the pause icon shown when the game is paused, to make your UI just that little more unique.

Change the image using a picker, set Image size, rotation speed and even the pause message from the module configuration screen.
in v0.3.0 a color picker has been added for ease of setting the color.

And enjouy a simple UI change!
