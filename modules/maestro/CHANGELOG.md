## [0.9.0] - 2022-08-22
> This update adds support for Foundry VTT v10

### Combat Tracks
- **Combat Track Config** is no longer accessible from the Combat Tracker tab and is now available from the Combat Tracker Config form instead (the cog/gear icon in the Combat Tracker).
- - This change was made to avoid overloading the Combat Tracker controls.
- All GMs in a game can now access the **Combat Track Config**. 

### Hype Tracks
- Players can once again configure **Hype Tracks** for Actors they are the Owner of.

### Miscellaneous
- **Maesto Config** (aka Crit Success/Failure config) is no longer available in the Playlist tab in the sidebar. It is still available in the Module Settings.
- - This change was made to avoid overloading the Playlist tab actions.
- **Crit Success/Failure Tracks** should now work for modified rolls (eg. advantage/disadvantage in dnd5e)
- All GMs in a game can now edit the **Critical Success/Failure Tracks** config. 

### Localization
- Updated Spanish translation (thanks @lozanoje ðŸŽ‰)

## [0.8.0] - 2021-12-31
> This update adds support for Foundry VTT v9
### Hype Tracks
- Added the ability to select a Hype Tracks playlist per Actor and additionally play all, or a random track (sound) from the selected playlist
- Suppressed the playback of Hype Tracks during Round 0 of Combat. This fixes the unintended repeated playing of the current combatant's Hype Track (if any) while initiative is being rolled. (Thanks @k-barber ðŸŽ‰) 
- Fixed an issue that caused Hype Tracks to not resume playing other sounds (eg. Combat Track) when the round changes and the first Combatant has a Hype Track

### Item Tracks
- Added tracking of deleted owned items and their associated Item Tracks so tracks can still be played. This fixes a bug where consumable items (eg. items with charges) that were set to `Destroy on Empty` (or similar) use would not play their Item Track

### Miscellaneous
- Implemented a system to find the first active GM whenever an elevated/privileged action is required (eg. setting a `world` setting). Previously it was only checked if the current user was a GM, which could lead to unintended consequences or "race conditions" when multiple GMs were logged in

### Localization
- Spanish translation updated (as of 0.7.6) - thanks @lozalojo ðŸŽ‰

## [0.7.6] - 2021-10-03
### Item Tracks
- Improved the detection of token/actor and items in chat messages for Item Tracks
- Added a setting for the item-id attribute checked for in chat messages for Item Tracks
> These changes combined should greatly improve compatibility with different game systems
### Various
- Random playback option in Hype, Combat, Critical Success/Failure Tracks is now actually random again
- Playlist loop toggle can now only be seen/set by a GM which avoids an error that occurs when a non-GM tries to configure it
- When Hype/Combat Tracks pause sounds, they will now pause regardless of whether the playlist itself is marked as "playing"
### Hype Tracks
- When combat ends Hype Tracks will also end
- Hype Tracks correctly pause Combat Tracks
### Combat Tracks
- Combat Tracks now include a setting to pause other playlist sounds while they are playing. At the end of a Combat Track, the previously paused sounds should resume
- If there is a combat encounter the Combat Tracks config will open to the ENCOUNTER tab instead of DEFAULTS
### Critical Success/Failure Tracks
- Critical Success/Failure Tracks now include settings to configure the number of faces/die type (eg. 20 for d20) to trigger off and the threshold for success and failure
