Outside of SRD:
Some NPCs, creatures and items in this module are not included in SRD licensing. Those have been created by me and have a suggestive names that helps you to place them in the Adventure. Of course you as a DM have full freedom on changing the names of NPCs in order to fit them into your adventure even better.

Art:
Most of the arts are taken from SRD module which as an ad-on to the dnd5 system in Foundry Vtt v11.
NPC Portraits and tokens for material outside of SRD has been generated by AI engines or taken from Pintereast (in that case there is a link to each art). Below there is a list of art pieces which I'm not the author of:
